## ðŸ“– About

This repository houses the codebase for my personal website, [seanmcn.com](https://seanmcn.com).

Built with the power of Gatsby, the site dynamically serves blog content sourced from Markdown & [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files located in [content/blog](https://github.com/Seanmcn/my-website/tree/develop/content/blog). Deployment is made seamless with AWS Amplify, using a [custom image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/y1e1i7y7/gatsby-5.11_amazonlinux-latest) for optimised performance.
