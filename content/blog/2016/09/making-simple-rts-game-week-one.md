So I’ve decided I want to make a game again, nothing crazy just a simple RTS game, browser based (mainly for speed of development and that I’m interested to see what it’s like),  I’ve decided I may as well blog along the journey to keep myself motivated and prevent quitting mid-way through.

I might also do some videos & live streams as we get closer a prototype and there is actually something interesting to watch me doing rather than researching things. So watch this space.

So far stack wise I’ve decided on using the following tools:

- [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) – Open source HTML5 Game Framework
- [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) – Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

I need to find a tool for making tile based maps, but I’m not too concerned about that right now, I’d prefer to start with controls, units and economy before jumping into anything too graphical and getting demotivated.

I think plan wise of order of doing things will go like so:

- Controls
- Camera – Camera movement etc.
- Units – basic movement and control
- Economy – basic income system
- Unit Types
- Unit Attacking
- Map – singular
- Game State – Playing, Game Over, Winner etc.
- Lobby System – Find Game etc.
- Chat

I’ve probably forgotten some thing’s but that’s just a kind of overview for now, I’ll probably make a Trello board and share that at some stage.

Graphics wise I’m worried, I’m intending on the graphics for the game to be super basic, probably just spheres initially, if I am actually enjoying how the game is progressing I’ll either put myself through the pain of trying to do graphic design or (more likely) pay someone to do it for me.

Anyway that’s all I really have to say on this for now, I’m going to try do weekly updates if not bi-weekly. Hopefully motivation will stay with me!
