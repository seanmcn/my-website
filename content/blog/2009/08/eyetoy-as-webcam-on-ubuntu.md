People say using linux is complicated. That just isn't true anymore. Back when I first started using Ubuntu there was not much support for using the Eyetoy as a webcam. Now however using the eyetoy as a webcam is a walk in the park!

Just open up a terminal window and copy the following into it:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ov51x-jpeg-source module-assistant
module-assistant a-i ov51x-jpeg
```

And as easy as that, your webcam is working!
