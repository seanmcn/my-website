I just took a fun test on "What is your programmer personality?" It is based of the [Myers-Briggs Personality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) and has been changed to relate to your programming personality type.

> Your programmer personality type is:
>
> **DLSB**
>
> **You're a Doer**.
>
> You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.
>
> **You like coding at a Low level.**
>
> You're from the old school of programming and believe that you should have an intimate relationship with the computer. You don't mind juggling registers around and spending hours getting a 5% performance increase in an algorithm.
>
> **You work best in a Solo situation.**
>
> The best way to program is by yourself. There's no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.
>
> **You are a liBeral programmer.**
>
> Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.
