### What is Programmers Day?
Programmer's day is a whimsical "holiday" on the 256th day of the year celebrated mostly by computer programmers (reason: 256 = 2 to the power of 8 = the number of values representable in a byte of data).

Traditions include drinking, behaving silly, coding silly programs, mini computer games, playing with old computers, etc. Programmer's day usually falls on September 13th; on leap years, it is September 12th.

### Why the 256th Day of the year?
A byte can have 256 possible values, bytes are very important to programmers. Not because they are required for programs to work, but because the payroll system and Krispy Kreme doughnut cash registers require them.
