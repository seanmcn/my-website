I was trying to use a get .debs website the other day and with a lot of frustration of firefox saying `Firefox does not have the correct protocol to open this file [.apt]` I finally figured out that I did not have `apt-url` installed on kUbuntu.

This can be fixed by simply opening a terminal window and typing:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apturl
```
Then restart firefox. Go to download another .deb / .apt file and when it asks you what you would like to use to open the file browse to `/usr/bin` and pick whatever installs your programs.
