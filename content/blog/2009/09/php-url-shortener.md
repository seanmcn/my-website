If you use URL shortening services like [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/) , it may be worth your while to setup a domain shortening service on your own domain. This is quiet easily done with a WordPress plugin now.

[YOURLS](https://yourls.org/) is a free PHP script created by Lester Chan and Ozh Richard that allow you to create something similar to TinyURL.

- It is easy to install.
- It has a statistic side that allows you to keep track of all the URLs you are currently using.
- It also easily allows you to choose between making your service open for all or just for you.
- It lets you have customizable links instead of random characters.
- Lastly it has a bookmarklet that allows you to make TinyURLs on the fly!
