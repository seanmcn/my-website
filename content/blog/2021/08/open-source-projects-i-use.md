I'm currently on a train from London -> Sheffield, and while the views of the countryside rolling by are nice, I figured now would be a good time for another blog post. So I'm going to go through a few pieces of software I use frequently at work which are all open source and in my opinion worth checking out.

- [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) - This is a fantastic piece of software that enables easy conversion between markup formats. I mainly use it to write documentation in a markdown editor and then convert it to MediaWiki format.

- [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif) - ScreenToGif allows you to record your screen and save it as, you guessed it, a GIF. I find this incredibly useful for sharing quick demos / new functionality in video format.

- [Draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) - Draw.io is a tool for making UML diagrams and flowcharts. I use this a lot to describe flows of functionality/system architecture changes.

- [Git Inspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector) - This is a handy little tool for getting stats out of a git repository, particularly useful on private repos. It unfortunately hasn't been updated since 2020, but the last time I used it I had no issues.

- [Git Recall](https://github.com/Fakerr/git-recall) - This great tool for being able to quickly browse through commits, viewing the diff of each one in terminal. It's best explained with the following image:

 That's all I have for now, while browsing through my starred GitHub repositories I've found a number that are probably worth sharing, so I'll potentially make another of these posts on my return journey.
