After switching over my blog to Gatsby and using markdown, I have been on the lookout for a decent markdown editor to use for writing. Up until now, I have been using a combination of [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) and [Markdown Navigator Enhanced](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator-enhanced) in [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

I switch between a windows desktop computer and a MacBook throughout the day, so having the same software on both platforms was vital to me. I also wanted something open-source, as I'm trying to focus on making more open-source contributions.

Well, I've found something that satisfies both of the above: [Mark Text](https://github.com/marktext/marktext).

I could talk about all of its features and how its interface is beautifully minimalistic, but you can read all about that [on their Github](https://github.com/marktext/marktext).
