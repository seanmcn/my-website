While converting over [my previous post](/blog/2009/11/programmer-personality) of my Programmer Personality, I decided to do it again and see whats changed, as expected it has.

> Your programmer personality type is:
>
> **DLSB**
>
> **You're a Planner.**.
>
> You may be slow, but you'll usually find the best solution. If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
>
> **You like coding at a High level.**
>
> The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.
>
> **You work best in a Team.**
>
>  A good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.
>
> **You are a liBeral programmer.**
>
> Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.
